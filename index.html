When Watchman takes damage, an energy barrier is automatically generated.</p>

              <p class="mt-4">I would say Farlight is pretty good on its own. It takes alot of things that made other BRs work and has some nice mechanics from Vehicles to Jetpacks. Characters are pretty neat too, being slightly distinct from one another with just enough differences. Movement is pretty good too. The addition of Jetpacks adds verticality to the game and more finesse mixed with cooldown management. My only request is to try new abilities. Im looking forward to what you can do :)

I'm giving it 💯, the graphics are exceptional, it does not require money, only your network connection, it has various stages and arenas, characters have unique features, the guns are super effective, controls are user friendly you can literally master them in less then a day. It's just amazing from my side. I've postponed writing this review because certain updates can take the fun off a game, but the updates here enhanced my experience 10 times more.

                          The game is good over-all, fun to play and the controls are not complicated. Very beginner friendly. My only concern is that can you separate the lobbies between mobile and pc players. It's hard to compete with pc players. I've played on both devices so I know first hand how convenient to use keyboards/mouse or console compared to mobile. (And no it is not because I'm lagging, tbh there's no lag or fps drops) Please consider this on the future updates, we'd really appreciate it thank you!
